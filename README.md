# ECS Cost-effectiveness analyzer
Python library and dashboard to perform deterministic and probabilistic cost effectiveness analysis of
different carrier screening strategies.

## Mathematical Model


![plot](./resources/ecs.jpg)

Model parameters:

- $p_{carrier}(d)$ carrier rate for disease $d$
- $p_{risk}(d)$ probability for the couple to be at risk for disease $d$
- $\epsilon_{CS}$ false negative rate for carrier screening
- $\rho$ not-intervention probability
- $\epsilon_{PGT}$ intervention failure probability
- $C(d)$ healthcare cost for disease $d$
- $L(d)$ life expectancy change caused by disease $d$
- $\mathcal{D}(\mathcal{S})$ set of diseases screened by strategy $\mathcal{S}$ 
- $C_{CS}(\mathcal{S})$ carrier screening cost for strategy $\mathcal{S}$
- $C_{intervention}$ intervention cost

In case of recessive disease, the probability for a couple to be at risk is:

$$p_{risk}(d) = p_{carrier}(d)^2$$

In case of X-linked disease, the probability for a couple to be at risk is:

$$p_{risk}(d) = p_{carrier}(d)$$

Probability for a child to be affected in case strategy does not screen for disease $d$ is given by Mendelian inheritance rule:

$$p_{affected}(d)=\frac{1}{4} p_{risk}(d)$$

Probability for a child to be affected in case strategy screens for disease $d$:

$$p_{affected}(d)=\frac{1}{4} p_{risk}(d)\left[ \epsilon_{CS} + (1-\epsilon_{CS})\rho + (1-\epsilon_{CS})(1-\rho)\epsilon_{PGT}  \right]$$

Intervention probability in case strategy screens for disease $d$:

$$p_{intervention}(d)=\frac{1}{4} p_{risk}(d) (1-\epsilon_{CS})(1-\rho)$$


The average total cost for strategy $\mathcal{S}$, screening for disease $\{d_1,...,d_N\}$ is:

$$C(\mathcal{S}) = C_{CS}(\mathcal{S}) + \sum_{d\in\mathcal{D}(\mathcal{S})} p_{intervention}(d) C_{intervention} + \sum_{d\in\mathcal{D}(\mathcal{S})} p_{affected}(d) C(d)$$

The average number of life years gained (LYG) for strategy $\mathcal{S}$ assuming additive disease effects is:

$$LYG(\mathcal{S}) = \sum_{d\in\mathcal{D}(\mathcal{S})} p_{affected}(d) L(d)$$

The Increamental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio (ICER) between strategy $\mathcal{S_1}$ and $\mathcal{S_2}$ is:

$$ICER(\mathcal{S_1};\mathcal{S_2}) = \frac{LYG(\mathcal{S_2})-LYG(\mathcal{S_1})}{C(\mathcal{S_2})-C(\mathcal{S_1})}$$

## Use docker to run ECS cost-effectiveness Dashboard locally 

Create docker image:

    docker build -t ecs_dashboard

Run the image as container:

    docker run -p 8080:8053 ecs_dashboard

Visit [0.0.0.0:8080](http://0.0.0.0:8080/) to access dashboard

The dashboards allows to perform deterministic and probabilistic cost-effectiveness analysis with 
custom parameters, custom disease list and custom screening stategies. Disease list and custom strategies 
can be uploaded as excel files, which should be formatted as the examplary files in data/ folder of the github repository.

## Run cost-effectiveness analysis on jupyter notebook

A jupyter notebook to perform deterministic and probabilistic analysis is availalble in 
notebook/cost_effectivness_notebook.ipynb. Make sure that dependencies listed in requirements.txt are satisfied.
